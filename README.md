## **Beginner Section**

### **Introduction**
MongoDB Ops Manager is a management tool for MongoDB deployments. It provides automation, monitoring, backup, and scaling capabilities.

#### **Architecture**
- **Components**: Ops Manager Server, MongoDB Agents, Backing Databases.
- **How It Works**: Agents report metrics to Ops Manager, which processes and displays them.

#### **Example Deployments**
- Simple Test Deployment: A single-node setup for learning purposes.
